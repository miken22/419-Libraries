/**
 * class that holds diffusion mechanisms for graphs to undergo information dissemination
 * Mechanisms include:
 *
 *                              Initial Cascade
 *
 * the graph has an infection probability P, each infected node has probability P to
 * infect its neighbours. Once it tries to infect a neighbour once it never tries to
 * infect it again.
 *
 * Initially no nodes are infected but a seed is chosen to infect at time t=0 who will
 * begin the infection. After this there are subsequent infections at each step a node
 * that was infected in the previous rounds tries to infect an un-infected neighbours
 * this process continues until no new nodes are infected.
 *
 *
 *                              Linear Threshold
 *
 * This model represents infection as having a large enough number of neighbours being infected
 * so then a node would succumb to the infection.
 *
 * The graph/nodes are defined with a threshold T where if enough of a nodes neighbours
 * are infected such that T < (# of infected neighbours/total # of neighbours).
 *
 *
 *                                  Notes
 *
 * All mechanisms must be passed graphs with the corresponding vertex types for their diffusion.
 * Random graph generation is not supported as the generators only create the generic vertex type
